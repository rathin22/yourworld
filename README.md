# YourWorld
This is a simple single-page-app I created to learn JavaScript, creating REST APIs, and basic testing with Jest.

The website is like a picture log where you can add places that you have visited and then add pictures you captured of those places. Basically a collection of your pictures, categorized by location.

## Running the website:
Clone down this repository. You will need `node` and `npm` installed globally on your machine.
In this folder, first run:

npm install
```
Then to start the website:

The website will run on `127.0.0.1:8090`
